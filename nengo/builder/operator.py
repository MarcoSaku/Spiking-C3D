    The lifetime of a Signal during one simulator timestep:

    0. at most one set operator (optional)
    1. any number of increments
    2. any number of reads
    3. at most one update

    A signal that is only read can be considered a "constant".

    A signal that is both set *and* updated can be a problem:
    since reads must come after the set, and the set will destroy
    whatever were the contents of the update, it can be the case
    that the update is completely hidden and rendered irrelevant.
    There are however at least two reasons to use both a set and an update:

    - to use a signal as scratch space (updating means destroying it)
    - to use sets and updates on partly overlapping views of the same
      memory.

    N.B.: It is done on purpose that there are no default values for
    reads, sets, incs, and updates.

    Each operator should explicitly set each of these properties.
