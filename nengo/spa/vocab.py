class Vocabulary(object):
    """A collection of semantic pointers, each with their own text label.

    The Vocabulary can also act as a dictionary, with keys as the names
    of the semantic pointers and values as the SemanticPointer objects
    themselves.  If it is asked for a pointer that does not exist, one will
    be automatically created.

    Parameters
    -----------
    dimensions : int
        Number of dimensions for each semantic pointer
    randomize : bool, optional
        Whether to randomly generate pointers.  If False, the semantic
        pointers will be [1,0,0,...], [0,1,0,...], [0,0,1,...] and so on.
    unitary : bool or list of strings, optional
        If True, all generated pointers to be unitary.  If a list of
        names, any pointer whose name is on the list will be forced to be
        unitary when created.
    max_similarity : float, optional
        When randomly generating pointers, ensure that the cosine of the
        angle between the new pointer and all existing pointers is less
        than this amount.  If the system is unable to find such a pointer
        after 100 tries, a warning message is printed.
    include_pairs : bool, optional
        Whether to keep track of all pairs of pointers as well.  This
        is helpful for determining if a vector is similar to A*B (in
        addition to being similar to A or B), but exponentially increases
        the processing time.
    rng : numpy.random.RandomState, optional
        The random number generator to use to create new vectors

    Attributes
    ----------
    keys : list of strings
        The names of all known semantic pointers ('A', 'B', 'C')
    key_pairs : list of strings
        The names of all pairs of semantic pointers ('A*B', 'A*C', 'B*C')
    vectors : numpy.array
        All of the semantic pointer values in a matrix, in the same order
        as in keys
    vector_pairs : numpy.array
        The values for each pair of semantic pointers, convolved together,
        in the same order as in key_pairs
    include_pairs : bool
        Whether to keep track of all pairs of pointers as well.  This
        is helpful for determining if a vector is similar to A*B (in
        addition to being similar to A or B), but exponentially increases
        the processing time.
    identity : SemanticPointer
        The identity vector for this dimensionality [1, 0, 0, 0, ...]
